# ElevenLabs Demo Script - E-Learning Platform Backend

## Script for Non-Technical Founders (~1 minute)

Imagine building your own online course platform, like Udemy or Teachable, but one you fully own and control. Let me show you what powers this e-learning platform behind the scenes.

The backend is built on Supabase, a modern database that handles everything automatically. Think of it as the brain of your platform, organizing all your data securely in the cloud.

Here's how it works: When instructors join your platform, they can create courses, organize them into modules, and add lessons. Each lesson can be a video, written content, or even a quiz. The system automatically keeps everything in order.

When students enroll in a course, the platform tracks their progress in real-time. It remembers which videos they've watched, how far they got, and automatically calculates their completion percentage. Students can pick up exactly where they left off, on any device.

The best part? Everything is automated. When a student finishes all lessons, the system knows it and can instantly generate their completion certificate. No manual work required.

Security is built-in from day one. Students only see their own progress, instructors only manage their own courses, and all data is encrypted and protected. This isn't something you'll need to worry about later - it's already handled.

This backend is designed to scale. Whether you have ten students or ten thousand, the platform performs smoothly. It's the foundation that lets you focus on growing your business, not managing servers.
